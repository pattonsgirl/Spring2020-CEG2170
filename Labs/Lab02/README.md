# Lab 02

## Getting Started

Download the Windows-Template or MacLinux-Template file from Pilot.  This contains settings  
for programming in VS Code.  Extract the file to a directory of your choice (such as CEG2170).  
You will now have a folder named Template that contains:
* .vscode
* code.c
* Makefile

Make a copy of the Template folder and name it Lab02-LastName (where last name is your last name)

In Visual Studio Code, go to File, Open Folder, and open your folder (Lab02-LastName)

Rename code.c if desired.  If you rename it, be sure to update the Makefile variable PROGNAME  
with the new name of your file.

To run from VS Code, use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + C` to open the Windows Command Terminal.  
The file path should be your project folder by default.

Type `make run` - this will compile and run your code file.  
If it fails, see the Troubleshooting Guide in [Setting Up Your Environment](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/Spring2020-CEG2170)

This link to [Introduction to C](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson1.html) is a good resource for the remainder of this lab.
