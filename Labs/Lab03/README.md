# Lab 02

## Getting Started

Download the Windows-Template or MacLinux-Template file from Pilot.  This contains settings  
for programming in VS Code.  Extract the file to a directory of your choice (such as CEG2170).  
You will now have a folder named Template that contains:
* .vscode
* code.c
* Makefile

**It is recommended to create a project folder for *each* part of this lab.**
Folder structure:
* Create a folder named Lab02-Lastname.  
* Inside of Lab02, create two more folders (Part1 and Part2).
* You can copy the files from the Template folder into Part1 and Part2   

In Visual Studio Code, go to File, Open Folder, and open the folder corresponding to which part of  
this lab your are working on.

Rename code.c if desired.  If you rename it, be sure to update the Makefile variable PROGNAME  
with the new name of your file.

To run from VS Code, use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + C` to open the Windows Command Terminal.  
The file path should be your project folder by default.

Type `make run` - this will compile and run your code file.  
If it fails, see the Troubleshooting Guide in [Setting Up Your Environment](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/Spring2020-CEG2170)

This link to [Introduction to C](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson1.html) is a good resource for the remainder of this lab.

## Part 1:
Find the greatest of 3 numbers using if/else or if/elseif/else statements.  Use scanf to read the numbers.  Numbers can have decimal values.

Use a switch statement to create a grade categorizer?

## Part 2:


## What to Submit
You created two project folders, one for each part of this lab, inside of a master folder named Lab02-LastName.  
Each folder should have at least the following:
* name_of_your_code.c
Create a .zip file of your project folder (Lab02-LastName.zip)

Windows:
1. Choose the folder you'd like to zip.
2. Right-click the folder, point to Send to, and then click Compressed folder(zipped). 
3. A new zipped folder will appear 
 
Mac & Linux:
1. Choose the folder you'd like to zip.
2. Ctrl + click the folder and click Compress. 
3. A new zipped folder will appear 

Upload your .zip file to Pilot.
