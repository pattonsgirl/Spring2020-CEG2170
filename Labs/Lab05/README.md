# Lab 05 - NOT FINISHED

## Getting Started

Download the Windows-Template or MacLinux-Template file from Pilot.  This contains settings  
for programming in VS Code.  Extract the file to a directory of your choice (such as CEG2170).  
You will now have a folder named Template that contains:
* .vscode
* code.c
* Makefile

Folder structure:
* Create a folder named Lab05-Lastname.

In Visual Studio Code, go to File, Open Folder, and open the folder corresponding to which part of  
this lab your are working on.

Rename code.c if desired.  If you rename it, be sure to update the Makefile variable PROGNAME  
with the new name of your file.

To run from VS Code, use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + C` to open the Windows Command Terminal.  
The file path should be your project folder by default.

Type `make run` - this will compile and run your code file.  
If it fails, see the Troubleshooting Guide in [Setting Up Your Environment](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/Spring2020-CEG2170)

This link to [Arrays in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm) is a good resource for this lab.
