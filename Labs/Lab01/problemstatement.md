# Lab 01
Create a folder called Lab01-LastName (where last name is your last name)

## Part 1
Create a program that reads in your name from standard in and prints your name to standard out.

Input format:  
`Enter your name: `

Output format (replace John Smith with your name):  
`Your name is John Smith`

## Part 2
Modify the above program so that it also reads a number from standard input and outputs the area  
of a circle based on that input.  Set the value of pi to the nearest three decimal places with  
`#define`.  You may use the `math.h` library

Formula: A = pi * r^2

Modified input format:  
`Enter your name: `  
`Enter the radius of your circle: `

Modified output format:  
`Your name is John Smith`  
`38 is the area of your circle.`

Save your program output to a file named output.txt using copy & paste

Your folder should have the following:
name_of_your_code.c
program.exe
output.txt
